# Decision Clarity Rules

## When Providing Multiple Options

1. **State recommendation clearly upfront**
   - Lead with: "I recommend Option X because..."
   - Don't present options as equal if one is clearly better

2. **One definitive answer per problem**
   - If multiple solutions exist, pick one and explain why
   - Don't create multiple files with different approaches
   - If user asks for options, present them but still recommend one

3. **Consolidate before presenting**
   - Review all files created before showing to user
   - Delete/consolidate duplicate files
   - One SQL file, one code change file, one explanation file

4. **Clear action items**
   - Numbered steps (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
   - One file to run, one method to change
   - No ambiguity about what to do next

## When Changing Recommendations

1. **Acknowledge the change**
   - "I've reconsidered - here's why Option X is actually better..."
   - Explain what changed your mind

2. **Clean up previous files**
   - Delete or clearly mark as "superseded"
   - Don't leave multiple conflicting files

3. **Final answer format**
   - Create ONE final file: `FINAL_*.sql` or `FINAL_*.md`
   - Mark it clearly as the definitive version

## File Naming Conventions

- `*_FINAL.sql` - The one SQL file to run
- `*_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step instructions
- `*_ANALYSIS.md` - Explanation/reasoning (optional)
- Delete or mark as `*_OLD.md` for superseded files

## Before Presenting to User

1. Count files created - if > 3, consolidate
2. Check for conflicting instructions - resolve them
3. Ensure one clear "do this next" action
4. Delete or mark old/duplicate files
