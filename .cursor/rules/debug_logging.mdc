# Debug Logging Rules

## CRITICAL: Never Use logger.info() for Debug Output
- **ALWAYS use `print()` for debug output that needs to be visible in server logs**
- `logger.info()` is often filtered out by uvicorn log levels
- Only use `logger.error()` or `logger.warning()` for actual errors/warnings that should be in logs
- **For all debug/trace information that the user needs to see, use `print()`**

## When Adding Logging
- Before adding any logging statement, ask: "Does the user need to see this in the console?"
- If YES → Use `print()`
- If NO (only for production logs) → Use `logger.error()` or `logger.warning()`
- **NEVER use `logger.info()` for user-visible debug output**

## Preventing Overwriting Changes
- **Be explicit about your assumptions and intentions in chat before making changes**
- **If you're modifying code that was recently changed, clearly state what you're changing and why**
- Don't blame the user for issues caused by overwriting your own previous fixes
- If you notice a collision issue, check if you previously fixed it and then broke it again

## CRITICAL: Check Documentation Before Making Assumptions
- **Before guessing or assuming how an external library/tool works, CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION**
- **What I CAN do:**
  - Search the codebase for existing usage/patterns
  - Read code comments and docstrings
  - Look at example code in the repository
  - Analyze the actual code that uses the library
- **What I CANNOT do:**
  - Access external websites or documentation directly
  - Run web searches to look up official docs
  - Access online resources outside the codebase
- **If working with external APIs, models, or libraries (e.g., YAMNet, TensorFlow, Supabase):**
  - First search the codebase for existing usage patterns
  - Read any comments/README files that explain behavior
  - Look at constants/variables that define parameters (e.g., `patch_duration = 0.48`)
  - If unclear, explicitly state assumptions in chat before implementing
- **DO NOT make assumptions about precision, timing, data formats, or behavior without checking available code/comments**

## Preventing Overengineering
- **Don't add features unless explicitly requested**
- If the user asks "why does X happen?", fix X, don't add Y
- If debugging something, add minimal logging to solve the problem, not a comprehensive system
- **Before adding any new abstraction, class, or system, ask: "Is this necessary or am I overengineering?"**

## Code Review Checklist Before Submitting Changes
1. ✅ Did I use `print()` for any debug output that needs to be visible?
2. ✅ Did I check documentation for external libraries/tools instead of guessing?
3. ✅ Did I check if my changes overwrite any user modifications?
4. ✅ Am I adding features that weren't requested?
5. ✅ Is my solution the simplest one that works?
